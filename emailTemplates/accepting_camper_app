<pre><font face="arial">Hey {{FIRST_NAME}} {{LAST_NAME}},

Congrats! You've been accepted for {{WEEK_NAME}} week at Summer Spark 2021. Go to the <a href="{{URL}}">status page</a> to check out your status for this and other weeks, and make sure to get your guardian(s) to help complete the required registration paperwork soon.

You should expect an email from us a little later in the summer with more details about attending camp and what to bring. For now, you should know:
	* This week of camp runs from {{START}} to {{END}}.
	* Camp runs from 9am EDT to 4pm EDT.
	* If you are an in-person camper, we'll let you know a bit later how early you can be dropped off / get picked up as well as lunch details.
	* If you are an online camper, camp will be available 24/7 during the camp week, but synchronous activities with your cabin will happen at different times between 9am and 4pm. We'll give you a daily schedule before camp begins.
	* Please let us know by email at spark@stab.org if you'd like to switch to being an in-person or virtual camper.

We can't wait to meet you,
-- Your Summer Spark Volunteers & Friends
