<pre><font face="arial">Hello {{FIRST_NAME}} {{LAST_NAME}},

{{CHILD_NAME}} has been accepted for {{WEEK_NAME}} week at Summer Spark 2021. Go to the <a href="{{URL}}">status page</a> to check out their status for this and other weeks, and make sure to complete the required registration paperwork (health information; required consent & release) for {{CHILD_NAME}} soon.

Please expect an email from us a little later this spring with extra logistical details about attending camp and what to bring. For now, you should know:
	* This week of camp runs from {{START}} to {{END}}.
	* Camp runs from 9am EDT to 4pm EDT.
	* If {{CHILD_NAME}} is attending in person, we'll let you know a bit later how early you can drop off & pick up.
	* If {{CHILD_NAME}} is an online camper, camp will be available 24/7 during the camp week, but synchronous activities (live streaming events, video calls) with your cabin will happen at different times between 9am and 4pm. We'll publish a daily schedule before camp begins.
	* Please let us know by email at spark@stab.org if you need to switch between in-person and virtual options, as space is limited.

Thank you for your support this summer,
